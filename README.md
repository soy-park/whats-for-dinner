# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
For this project, I built an app that makes meal suggestions for users who are debating on which meal to prepare. Users are able to choose an option (side, main, or dessert), and the app will display a randomly selected dish. The app incorporates HTML and CSS styling that mimics a comp. The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html). The app adds functionality to radio buttons, "Let's Cook" button, and "CLEAR" button by adding event listeners and handlers to these buttons.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Copy SSH key on GitHub inside the code dropdown
- Using the terminal, run git clone [SSH key here]
- Run command cd to move into project directory
- Run command open index.html to launch the application in the web browser

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This app was built during the third week of Mod 1 at the Turing School of Software and Design. It took me approximately 12-17 hours to complete the project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
##### Wins: 
1. Understanding the use of CSS flexbox
2. Being patient and detail-oriented so that the app matches the comp
3. Using event listeners and handlers 

##### Challenges:
1. Relying more heavily on independent research compared to other projects that required collaboration with others
2. Incorporating HTML span elements into list items while maintaining readability
